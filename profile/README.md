# Sonic Ecosystem Development Hub

Welcome to the Sonic Ecosystem Development Hub, the central organization for all projects related to Sonic and HyperGrid. Our mission is to revolutionize decentralized gaming by leveraging the power of Solana's Virtual Machine (SVM) and the scalability of HyperGrid.

## About Sonic

Sonic is the first atomic SVM chain designed to enable sovereign game economies on Solana. By utilizing the HyperGrid framework, Sonic offers unparalleled speed and scalability for on-chain gaming experiences. [Learn more about Sonic.](https://www.sonic.game/)

## About HyperGrid

HyperGrid is a rollup scaling and orchestration framework tailored for dedicated SVM ecosystem rollup operators. It achieves high transaction throughput for it's SVMs, enabling horizontal scaling across multiple grids. [Discover more about HyperGrid.](https://docs.sonic.game/developers/hypergrid-framework)

## Our Vision

We aim to unlock new experiences for both developers and players by expanding the Solana Gaming Ecosystem to process millions of requests per second per game, settling them back onto Solana L1.

## Key Features

- **‚ö° Gaming At the Speed Of Light:** Deliver the fastest on-chain game experience among all gaming L1s, powered by SVM.
- **üåê Atomic Interoperability:** Execute transactions on Sonic without redeploying your Solana programs and accounts, benefiting directly from Solana Layer1 services and liquidity.
- **üß© Composable Gaming Primitives:** Utilize on-chain gaming tools and data types via the [Rush ECS framework](https://docs.sonic.game/developers/rush-ecs-framework), allowing developers to build business logic efficiently.
- **üèóÔ∏è Monetization Infrastructure:** Access native growth, traffic, payment, and settlement infrastructure for games.

## Get Involved

We welcome contributions from developers passionate about decentralized gaming ecosystems and scaling SVMs. Explore our repositories, contribute to ongoing projects, or start your own within the Sonic ecosystem.
